# envil

ENVIL is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension which provides a A/V live-coding environment using [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/).

## Features

TODO

<!-- - Starting `sclang` and `scsynth` from vscode
- Evaluating selected text
- Evaluating regions between parentheses `( )`
- Hushing the server
- Highlight the lines that are being sent to be interpreted for like 2 seconds. -->

Tested only in Windows 10 Home.

## User Guide

TODO

<!-- 1. Install this extension
2. Install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
3. (optional) configure the location of your `sclang` instance in your vscode `settings.json`:
   - example: `"supercollider.sclang.cmd": "/Applications/SuperCollider.app/Contents/MacOS/sclang",`
4. The `scvsc` commands will be available in your vscode command palette, and you can map them to whatever keyboard shortcuts you like.
5. Alternatively, if you want to emulate the SCIDE keybindings, go to File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Extensions -> scvsc and set "Use Scide Keybindings" to `true`. -->
